# Setup and troubleshooting

[Back to README](../README.md) · [Tool reference](tools.md)

These instructions describe `main`. For an installed release, use the documentation at its tag in [Releases](https://github.com/Epistates/MCPSafari/releases).

This fork publishes no releases. Homebrew and the release downloads below install [upstream](https://github.com/Epistates/MCPSafari)'s build; to run this fork's code, install [from source](#from-source).

## Installation

### Homebrew (recommended)

Installs the MCP server binary and the Safari extension app to `/Applications`.

```bash
brew trust epistates/tap
brew install --cask epistates/tap/mcp-safari
```

The `brew trust` line is needed once. Installing a cask auto-trusts the cask itself, but this cask depends on the `mcp-safari-server` formula, and a differently named dependency in the same tap is not covered by that. Without it the install stops at `Refusing to load formula epistates/tap/mcp-safari-server from untrusted tap`.

Upgrading, both parts together:

```bash
brew upgrade --cask epistates/tap/mcp-safari
brew upgrade epistates/tap/mcp-safari-server
```

Upgrading only the cask leaves the server behind, because a cask depends on a formula being present rather than being any particular version. That gives you a new app and extension against an old server, which the versioned handshake rejects. `mcp-safari doctor` reports it as a version mismatch and names the fix, so it fails loudly rather than misbehaving.

Open MCPSafari.app once so Safari picks up the extension, then enable it in **Safari > Settings > Extensions > MCPSafari Extension**.

### From release

If you don't use Homebrew, download both the CLI binary and the extension app from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Epistates/MCPSafari/releases):

| Asset | Description |
|-|-|
| `MCPSafari-Server-arm64-apple-darwin` | MCP server binary for Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3, M4) |
| `MCPSafari-Server-x86_64-apple-darwin` | MCP server binary for Intel Macs |
| `MCPSafari-Server-universal-apple-darwin` | MCP server binary — universal, runs on any Mac |
| `MCPSafari-Extension-arm64.tar.gz` | Safari extension app for Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3, M4) |
| `MCPSafari-Extension-x86_64.tar.gz` | Safari extension app for Intel Macs |

```bash
# Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) — use x86_64 for Intel Macs
curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/mcp-safari https://github.com/Epistates/MCPSafari/releases/latest/download/MCPSafari-Server-arm64-apple-darwin
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mcp-safari

# Safari extension (must be in /Applications for macOS 26+)
curl -L https://github.com/Epistates/MCPSafari/releases/latest/download/MCPSafari-Extension-arm64.tar.gz | tar xzf -
mv MCPSafari.app /Applications/
open /Applications/MCPSafari.app
```

Then enable the extension in **Safari > Settings > Extensions > MCPSafari Extension**.

#### Checking what you downloaded

Every release asset from v0.4.0 onward carries a signed provenance attestation, so you can confirm a
file was built by this repository's release workflow rather than only that it downloaded intact:

```bash
gh attestation verify /usr/local/bin/mcp-safari --repo Epistates/MCPSafari
```

That needs the GitHub CLI and works offline after the first run. `SHA256SUMS` is published alongside
the assets as well, but a checksum only tells you the bytes match the ones we listed; it says nothing
about where they came from. Releases before v0.4.0 have checksums only.

### From source

See [Build from source](../README.md#build-from-source) for the short version, and [development](development.md) for requirements, tests, and architecture.

## Configuration

### Codex CLI

Register the server with Codex CLI:

```bash
codex mcp add mcp-safari -- mcp-safari
```

If `mcp-safari` is not in your `$PATH`, use the full path to the server binary:

```bash
codex mcp add mcp-safari -- /usr/local/bin/mcp-safari
```

Verify the registration:

```bash
codex mcp list
codex mcp get mcp-safari
```

Start a new Codex CLI session after registering the server. MCPSafari uses the MCP stdio transport, so use `--` before the command; `--url` is only for streamable HTTP MCP servers.

### Claude Code

Register the server with the Claude Code CLI (user scope, available in every project):

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user mcp-safari mcp-safari
```

Or, to scope it to a single repo, create `.mcp.json` at the project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-safari": {
      "command": "mcp-safari"
    }
  }
}
```

Verify with `claude mcp list` — you should see `mcp-safari — ✓ Connected`.

Claude Code does not read `mcpServers` from `~/.claude/settings.json`. Use `claude mcp add` or `.mcp.json`; otherwise, the client will not start the server.

### Claude Desktop

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-safari": {
      "command": "mcp-safari"
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor / Windsurf / other MCP clients

Any client that supports the MCP stdio transport can connect. Point it at `mcp-safari` (or the full path if not in `$PATH`).

### Multiple MCP clients

Each MCP client starts its own server. The server finds a free port if 8089 is in use, and the extension discovers servers in the 8089–8098 range. These connections share Safari tabs and browser state.

For ports outside the default range, set the port in the client configuration and add it in the extension popup:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-safari": {
      "command": "mcp-safari",
      "args": ["--port", "9090"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Safari profiles

Safari runs a separate instance of the extension in every profile it is enabled for, each with its own background page and its own tabs. All of them connect to the same server. The server keeps one connection per profile and lists them under `profiles` in `status`.

Every connected profile is drivable. `tabs_context` lists the tabs of all of them together, and each tab is named by a handle such as `p0t5` that says which profile it is in; pass that handle back as `tabId`. A call that names no tab drives the selected profile, which is the default one when it is connected, otherwise the first to connect, and `select_tab` moves it. Safari exposes no profile *name* to extensions, so `status` identifies profiles by the opaque UUID Safari assigns them alongside the short `p0` handle. See [Tools](tools.md#safari-profiles) for the details.

### CLI options

| Flag | Description |
|-|-|
| `--port <n>` / `-p <n>` | WebSocket port (default: `8089`) |
| `--log-level <level>` | `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `notice`, `warning`, `error`, or `critical` (default: `notice`) |
| `--verbose` | Shorthand for `--log-level debug` |
| `--help` / `-h` | Print usage and exit |
| `--version` / `-V` | Print the version and exit |

Logs go to stderr. The default level is `notice`; use `--log-level info` for startup and connection messages, or `--verbose` for debug logs. Clients that pass environment variables but not arguments can set `MCP_SAFARI_LOG_LEVEL`. An explicit flag takes precedence.

Diagnose an installation without starting the MCP server:

```bash
mcp-safari doctor
mcp-safari doctor --json
```

The doctor checks the server executable, app and extension bundles, PlugInKit registration, matching versions, and the selected port's token file. It never returns token contents and does not change system state.

## Troubleshooting

### Extension shows "Disconnected"

1. Run `mcp-safari doctor` and address any failed checks. If your version has no `doctor` command, continue with the steps below.
2. Check your MCP client logs to confirm it started the server.
3. Enable the extension in Safari settings, then click "Reconnect" in its popup.
4. Start the server through your client with `--verbose` to see connection logs.

### "Could not establish connection" errors

The content scripts may not be injected yet. The extension auto-injects on first interaction, but you can also reload the page.

### Safari permission prompts

Safari asks for website access the first time the extension touches a site, and it asks with a modal dialog that **can open behind another window**. While it is unanswered, every extension call for that tab is blocked, so a tool that needs the page fails with `permission_required` rather than waiting for it.

Click the MCPSafari toolbar button to see where you stand: the popup names the current site and whether MCPSafari can reach it, and opening it is also what prompts Safari to ask if it has not already. That is on purpose, since a question about MCPSafari is easiest to answer while you are looking at MCPSafari.

To stop being asked per site, click "Always Allow on Every Website" in Safari > Settings > Extensions > MCPSafari Extension. That is also the only way to reach cross-origin iframes, because Safari's per-site grant covers the top-level page only. MCPSafari runs locally, but tool results are sent to your MCP client and may be processed by its model provider. Grant only the sites you intend that client to access.

### Port already in use

The server tries other ports automatically. To choose a port outside 8089–8098, set `--port` and add that port in the extension popup. See [multiple MCP clients](#multiple-mcp-clients).
