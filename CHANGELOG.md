# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- JavaScript CodeQL coverage, immutable workflow action references, locked dependency resolution, and a tag-publishing gate requiring recorded real-Safari qualification.
- Release assets now carry a signed SLSA build provenance attestation, so `gh attestation verify <file> --repo Epistates/MCPSafari` ties a download back to the workflow run and commit that produced it. `SHA256SUMS` only ever said the bytes matched the ones we listed, which is a different claim and not the one someone handed a binary from elsewhere needs. The attestation covers the three CLI binaries and both extension archives, and is minted only on a tag, so a distribution dry run records provenance for nothing. Notarization is unrelated and stays: Apple attests that it scanned the bundle, not that this repository built it.
- Structured results now cover every tool's success path, including status, profile-qualified tab listings, interactions, screenshots, timed waits, and nested batch results. Text and HTML page reads preserve JSON-looking text verbatim, JavaScript results preserve JSON primitive types, and screenshot metadata avoids duplicating image bytes. Protocol-level tests exercise all 27 advertised tools against the actual server.
- Every tool result now carries its answer as data as well as prose. Failures have carried `structuredContent` since tool error codes shipped, so a caller got something parseable only when something went wrong; successes returned a paragraph. Each success now sets `structuredContent` to a one-key object naming its payload (`snapshot`, `matches`, `messages`, `requests`, `page`, `tab`, `window`, `result`, `wait`, `screenshot`), and a JSON listing arrives as an array a caller can index rather than a string they have to parse again. Text that is not JSON stays text, including a page whose whole content is `42` or `null`, which a parser alone would have retyped into a number or an absent value. The single key is required rather than stylistic: `structuredContent` may only be a JSON object before protocol revision 2026-07-28, and this server negotiates 2025-11-25. No `outputSchema` is declared to go with it, deliberately, since a declared schema makes clients reject any result that does not match and would turn every later shape change into a hard break while the tool surface is still settling.
- The extension popup names the current site and whether MCPSafari can reach it: allowed, asking, or no access. Safari grants website access one site at a time and reports that nowhere the user is looking, so "the agent cannot read this page" and "the server is not connected" used to look identical from outside. Opening the popup is also what prompts Safari to ask if it has not already, which puts its dialog in front of someone who is already looking at MCPSafari rather than behind a window mid-task.
- `mcp-safari doctor` reports which extension Safari is actually loading. Safari's own Uninstall button deletes `MCPSafari.app`, and on a machine with an Xcode checkout PlugInKit then falls back to whatever debug build is sitting in DerivedData. Neighbouring versions share a bridge protocol, so the handshake accepts the old build and nothing else in the product notices; the new `extension_location` check warns when the registered extension lives outside the installed app and says how to get back. It stays quiet when the app is installed somewhere else entirely, since `app_installed` already covers that.
- Every connected Safari profile is drivable. `tabs_context` now asks all of them and returns one merged listing, and each tool call goes to the profile its tab handle names. A profile that fails to answer `tabs_context` is named in the result rather than dropped, so a short listing is not mistaken for a closed tab. `status` gains a `handle` (`p0`) and a `selected` flag per profile, and `select_tab` moves the selection; it falls through to another profile if the pinned one goes away, so closing a window does not break calls that name no tab. Naming a profile that is not connected fails with `profile_not_connected` rather than answering from a different browser window.

### Changed
- **Breaking:** the app, extension and test bundles are identified as `app.eventra.MCPSafari`, `app.eventra.MCPSafari.Extension`, `app.eventra.MCPSafariTests` and `app.eventra.MCPSafariUITests` instead of `com.epistates.*`, so this fork can be signed under its own team. The extension's native-messaging host and `mcp-safari doctor`'s extension check follow. Safari treats it as a different extension from upstream's: enable it again in Safari's settings and grant its website access again.
- The repository's release, audit and smoke-test scripts are TypeScript in `scripts/`, run directly by Node 24, in place of the Python ones; their output and exit codes match the Python versions. The MCP tool-contract test moved alongside them. The repository root is a pnpm workspace, so `pnpm install && pnpm check` sets up and checks everything but the Swift server, and CI, the release workflow and the security scans install Node and pnpm instead of using Python.
- The extension's scripts are TypeScript, in `extension/`, bundled by tsdown and built by Xcode's new "Bundle extension scripts" phases, so the generated JavaScript is no longer checked in. The background page and the popup are written with Effect 4: each concern (tab access, the pinned tab, frame routing, the WebSocket connections, the router) is a service with a layer, every timeout is one configurable reference, and every failure is one `ToolError` schema that becomes the same bridge response as before. Code injected into pages (the content script and the five page-world scripts) stays dependency-free, because it is parsed into every page and frame; the build refuses to bundle a dependency into it. The content script is one bundle rather than seven files, guarded so a re-injection still registers no second listener and keeps the uids already handed out. Formatting, lint and typechecking use oxfmt, oxlint with the Effect and anti-slop rules, and TypeScript 7; the tests run under Vitest against the built bundles, exactly as Safari loads them. Behaviour is unchanged apart from three edges: a tool's own parameters are decoded at the background's boundary, so a malformed one is refused with `invalid_input`; a navigation that fails to start no longer leaves its load listener behind; and the popup's status reply arrives asynchronously.
- The tool-contract test now checks that the extension can actually serve every action the server sends. That boundary spans both languages and nothing covered it: the fixture answers any action it receives, including an unrecognised one, so a tool whose action name the extension did not know passed CI and would have reached a user as `Unknown action`. The names come from the server genuinely sending them during the run rather than from reading the Swift source, so there is no pattern to drift, and the answer comes from the extension's own dispatch tables. Removing one action from the router fails it.
- The bridge's handshake, status shapes and errors are three files beside the actor rather than inside it, which brings `WebSocketBridge.swift` to 884 lines. Only the stateless parts moved. The rest of that actor is one state machine running from listener to connection to handshake to authenticated send, measured at roughly three quarters of its members touching mutable bookkeeping, and splitting a state machine across files makes it harder to follow rather than easier. Nothing needed its access level widened.
- The request router is three lookup tables rather than a 130-line switch, which was the longest function in the extension. Nineteen of its arms differed only in their `case` label while all doing the same thing, so the one fact worth seeing, that almost every tool is simply handed to the content script, was the hardest to see. Adding a tool is now a line rather than an arm. The tables are `Map`s because the action name arrives off the WebSocket: as object literals, `constructor`, `toString`, `valueOf`, `hasOwnProperty` and `__proto__` would each have resolved through the prototype to an inherited function and been called as a handler instead of refused. That is now covered, along with the unknown-action path, which nothing tested before.
- The extension background is nine files instead of one of 1,592 lines, the largest now 307, loaded by the manifest in order. They are classic scripts sharing one global, so a function in any of them calls a function in any other with no imports, and only the last file runs anything at load. The manifest's `"type": "module"` went with the split: nothing ever used `import` or `export`, and keeping it would have given each file its own scope and broken every cross-file reference at once. A test now pins that, along with the agreement between the manifest, the test loader, and the re-injection list in the background, since nothing checked those against each other before and a file dropped from the manifest would have shipped as code the browser never loads.
- The MCP server's tool surface is five files instead of one of 2,523 lines, the actor itself now 1,173. The tool catalog, native keyboard and mouse input, screenshot capture, result formatting and `run_steps` validation each moved to their own file, chosen because none of them read actor state. Behaviour is unchanged: every moved line was byte-compared against the original, and the one assertion that the advertised tool set matches the set the contract test exercises still holds. Access levels now mark the seam, since Swift scopes `private` to a file: what is `internal` in those files is exactly what the handlers call, and the rest stayed private.
- The content script is seven files instead of one of 1,701 lines, the largest now 367. The manifest injects them in order and each is its own IIFE sharing one namespace, because the background script re-injects by name and top-level declarations would collide on the second pass. Behaviour is unchanged: the split was generated from the original with every code line accounted for, and four helpers moved so the dependency graph runs one way, from the foundation to the dispatcher that needs everything. Tests load the same list through one helper rather than naming the file in thirteen places.
- **Breaking:** `tabId` is now a tab handle string such as `p0t5`, meaning tab 5 of profile 0, rather than an integer. Safari runs a separate instance of the extension in every profile and each one numbers its own tabs, so a bare number named a different page in each. The handle carries the profile the way an element UID carries its frame (`f0e42`): no tool gained a profile argument. Handles come from `tabs_context`, which mints them, and from `tabs_create` and `select_tab`, which return them. An integer `tabId` is refused with `invalid_input` and a message naming the new form rather than being read as a tab in whichever profile happened to be selected.
- Dialog automation is now opt-in and one-shot: call `handle_dialog` before triggering a dialog, within 30 seconds. Native dialogs are unchanged outside that window; reading a captured result does not rearm interception.
- Console/network filters use a bounded regex subset and reject invalid or potentially expensive patterns instead of silently ignoring filters. Captured fields report truncation; bridge messages and in-flight requests have explicit limits.

### Fixed
- `form_input` and `type_text` set selects, checkboxes and radios. Every element got the text input's value setter, which throws "Illegal invocation" on a `<select>` and on the page body when nothing is focused, and only sets a checkbox's `value`, never whether it is checked. `form_input` also stopped at the first field that failed, after filling the ones before it; each field now reports its own outcome.
- `type_text` with `submitKey: "Enter"` submits only from a single-line input, and only when the page let the key through. It also submitted from textareas, where Enter is a new line, and after the page had handled Enter itself.
- Snapshots give a `value` only to controls that hold one. A list item's numeric `value` property is always 0, so every `<li>` reported `value: "0"`, and progress bars without a value reported a reading they did not have.
- Snapshot text leaves out the contents of `<style>`, `<script>`, `<noscript>` and `<template>`, so a component whose shadow root holds only styles no longer reads as CSS.
- `aria-labelledby` resolves ids inside the element's own shadow root, as `label[for]` already did.
- SVG links report their `href` as a URL rather than an empty object.
- `upload_file`, `drop_file` and the screenshot target lookup refuse a call with no `uid` or `selector` with `invalid_input`, rather than failing with "Cannot read properties of null".
- `press_key` accepts `+` and `Shift++`; splitting on `+` left no key at all.
- `prepare_native_key` no longer leaves `tabindex="-1"` on the page body after focusing it.
- `handle_dialog` says when it has armed interception for the next dialog, instead of reporting that no dialog was found.
- Element roles and scroll directions are looked up by own name only, so `scroll` with `direction: "toString"` is refused rather than scrolling with whatever `Object.prototype` returned.
- `wait` treats `timeout: 0` as a single check and `seconds: 0` as no wait, rather than as the defaults.
- `fetch(url, null)` works again on pages the network interceptor watches. The wrapper's default for `init` did not apply to `null`, so reading its method threw and a call the browser accepts failed. A `Request` is also recorded with its own method rather than as `GET`, and a fetch rejected with something other than an `Error` rejects unchanged instead of with a `TypeError`.
- `drop_file` reaches targets inside open shadow roots. The page side looked for its marker with `document.querySelector`, which sees one tree only, and failed with an error that also kept the isolated-world fallback from running. The marker is now compared as text, never parsed as a selector.
- Page-world failures always carry a message. A thrown value that was not an `Error` produced a reply with no error at all, which read as success with no data.
- `handle_dialog` fails straight away when the page's handler throws, rather than after its three-second timeout.
- A reused `XMLHttpRequest` is recorded once per request with its own timing. One opened again before it finished was recorded with a duration measured from 1970 and no timestamp, and each `send` added a listener, so later requests were recorded several times.
- Network trace events carry their documented types, `network.fetch` and `network.xhr`. The event's own details were spread over its type and timing, so they came out as `fetch` and `xhr` and an `eventTypes` filter naming the documented types matched nothing.
- A trace that never gets `stop_trace` expires after ten minutes and stops its URL poll and DOM observer, which otherwise ran for the life of the page.
- `read_console` shows `undefined`, functions and symbols as text instead of an empty string.
- A call that names no tab now reaches every frame. Without a `tabId`, the frame lookup was handed no tab and Safari refused it, so snapshots, `find`, and selector or text targeting quietly searched the top frame only; each frame's request also looked up the active tab again, so one call could end up split across two tabs. The tab is now resolved once per call.
- `javascript_tool` no longer runs code twice. Any error whose message mentioned a Content Security Policy was taken for a refusal to compile, including one thrown after the code had already run, and the code was then run again in the isolated world. Only a refusal to compile, when none of the code has run, falls back now. Its result also travels in an envelope of its own, so a returned object with an `__error` or `__cspBlocked` key is a value rather than a failure, and `throw ""` is reported as a failure.
- Calls checking the same tab's website access at the same time share one probe. `wait` puts its question to every frame at once, and each request started its own probe, asking Safari the same thing once per frame.
- A snapshot no longer drops frames nested inside a frame it cannot reach. They are attached to the nearest reachable frame and counted as unmatched, like any other frame whose host cannot be identified.
- `select_tab` pins a tab only once it has been brought to the front. A failure to activate it or focus its window left it pinned anyway, so later calls with no `tabId` went to a tab the caller had been told was not selected.
- The access-permission cache answers the question it is asked. It remembered only successful probes, so a blocked tab, which is the case it exists for, was probed again on every call and a frame search paid one probe per frame until the call ran past the bridge timeout. It was also keyed by tab alone while Safari grants by origin, so a `navigate` followed straight away by a read reused the previous origin's grant inside the two-second window and went back to waiting on the new origin's dialog unbounded. Refusals are cached with their origin and recovery intact, and a tab that navigates loses its entry.
- `resize_window` resizes the window the agent is driving. It read `tabs.query({ currentWindow: true })`, ignoring both `tabId` and the pin `select_tab` sets, so on a two-window setup it resized whichever window the user had clicked into and a screenshot afterwards did not match the viewport that was asked for.
- A `click` on a page with iframes can no longer fire twice. Targeting by selector or text tries each frame in turn, and any failure was read as "the target is not in this frame", so a frame that resolved the target and then failed handed the same action to the next frame that matched. A click that fired before something after it threw therefore fired again somewhere the caller never named. Only `target_not_found`, `wait_timeout` and `permission_required` move on now; anything else is the answer. `wait` is also put to every frame at once rather than in turn, because a selector that is not coming cost its whole timeout per frame, so a page with a few iframes ran past the bridge timeout and reported a generic failure in place of `wait_timeout`.
- A tab URL carrying `?token=` or `?session=` no longer reports the value. Those are the two most ordinary names in the class the redaction exists for, and neither was on its list, while the comment above it already claimed session values were covered. Presigned `X-Amz-Signature` URLs, `jwt`, `sig`, `authorization` and several other spellings are covered now too. Names that describe a secret rather than carrying one stay readable, so `token_type=bearer` and `password_hint` are unchanged. SECURITY.md documents the control and its two limits, which it did not mention at all before.
- The extension no longer gives up on a server that is still running. Its keepalive pruned any port "disconnected for longer than two minutes", but measured that from when the port authenticated rather than from when its socket went away, and that timestamp is never refreshed. So any server up longer than the grace period was dropped the first time Safari suspended the background page, which is the ordinary reason the socket closes. Pruning also recorded the live token as stale, and the server only mints a new one when it restarts, so the bridge stayed quiet until something was restarted. It now measures how long the socket has actually been gone, and closes the socket it is dropping rather than leaving one authenticating with nothing tracking it.
- A successful tool call is no longer reported as a failure with no reason, and a malformed frame no longer costs the full bridge timeout. The extension serialised its reply with `JSON.stringify(data)`, which is the value `undefined` rather than a string when a handler returns nothing, so the whole `data` key vanished from the frame and the server read a success as a contentless failure. `snapshot` reaches this whenever the top frame answers with a falsy tree. Separately, a frame that parsed to `null`, a number, or a bare string was destructured without an id, and the error path then failed a second time reading that id, so no reply was sent at all and the server waited out its thirty seconds.
- A tab waiting on Safari's permission dialog no longer hangs every call that names no tab. Resolving the active tab makes the same two calls `tabs_context` is deadlined for, and had no deadline at all, so one blocked tab put the whole tool surface back on the 30-second `bridge_timeout` with the wrong reason attached. A pinned tab blocked that way is also no longer treated as a closed one, which used to drop the caller's chosen tab over a question nobody had answered yet. `select_tab` and native input focus now check access before reading the tab, as `screenshot` already did. Navigating away from a blocked tab works rather than hanging: reading the page being left is best effort now, since leaving is the one move that gets a caller off a page they cannot use.
- A reconnecting Safari profile can no longer be mistaken for a closed one. Connections were tracked by `ObjectIdentifier`, which is the object's address, and an address is handed out again once the object behind it is gone. A new connection landing where a dead one used to be inherited its profile mapping and could take delivery of a response meant for it, silently and on the wrong profile. Each accepted socket now carries a counter that cannot repeat.
- `status` no longer describes one profile using another's numbers. The extension version and bridge protocol it reports were a single pair that every profile wrote to, so an old build rejected in a second profile relabelled a healthy first one with its own version, and `doctor` reported a mismatch for a bridge that was working. Those now come from whichever profile an untargeted call would drive, with each profile's own already listed in `profiles`. A build turned away for a protocol mismatch is still named when nothing is connected, which is when there is nothing better to report. A cancelled `tabs_context` is also no longer reported as every profile being unreachable with `CancellationError` given as the browser's reason. Profile ids are bounded and stripped of anything unprintable before they reach a log line or the MCP client, and the bridge tracks a fixed maximum of them rather than growing for as long as a client keeps inventing new ones.
- A local process can no longer keep Safari from connecting, and a second handshake can no longer strand a profile. At the cap on connections awaiting authentication the bridge evicted the oldest, which is whichever one is furthest along and so most likely to be the extension mid-handshake, so anything opening sockets in a loop could starve it out: the newest is now refused instead, and a socket that opens and then says nothing gives up its slot after a deadline rather than holding it forever. A handshake is also only read before a connection has one, since taking a second under a different profile id registered the same socket twice and left the first entry reporting as connected after the socket closed. A connection rejected for a protocol mismatch now frees its slot immediately rather than only when its write completes. Frames are handled one at a time: handling and re-arming the read were separate tasks, which Swift orders however it likes, so a handshake could be overtaken by the frame behind it and have its own connection closed as unauthenticated traffic.
- The bridge recovers from a failed bind instead of staying dead. `start()` set `listener` before knowing the bind had worked and never cleared it when the port sweep gave up, so the `listener == nil` guard turned every later `start()` into a silent no-op: once something held all ten ports in the range, nothing would listen again until the process restarted, and `status` reported a dead bridge with no reason attached. The sweep now releases each listener it abandons and records `bridge_bind_failed` with the range it tried. The bind also waits on a continuation that only `.ready` and `.failed` resumed, so a `.cancelled` listener left `start()` suspended forever and took the MCP server down with it before it could answer `initialize`.
- The bridge no longer leaks a connection per reconnect, or keeps serving a socket nobody reads. Every accepted connection and every listener stored a state handler that captured it, which is a cycle that outlives `cancel()`, so each Safari reconnect across a sleep, wake, or extension reload left its connection and receive buffers resident for the life of the process. A receive error or a close frame also returned without dropping the registry entry, so the profile kept reporting as connected while its read loop was over and every later call to it waited out the full 30-second timeout.
- `drag` no longer reports success on endpoints a real pointer could not reach. It took the raw centre of each element's rect, so a source or destination under a modal dragged without complaint, an element wider than the viewport was aimed outside it, and the destination was never scrolled into view at all, which put the drop at an off-screen coordinate whenever the target sat below the fold. Both ends are now scrolled to before either is measured, and both are hit-tested before anything is dispatched, so a refusal cannot leave the page holding a pointer down with nothing to drop. It fails with `target_covered` or `target_not_visible` the way `click` and `hover` do, and takes the same `force: true`.
- `click` and `hover` no longer report success on an element the user cannot reach. Text targeting took the first ranked match, so `text: "Delete"` on a list of rows silently acted on one of them; it now fails with `ambiguous_target` and the candidates' UIDs when several elements tie. A synthetic event also reached a target under a modal or banner; `click` and `hover` now hit-test the target first and fail with `target_covered` naming the element a real click would reach, or `target_not_visible` when the target has no area in the viewport. `force: true` restores the old dispatch. Text matches inside a control now act on the control, so a click on a button's label focuses the button.
- `snapshot` no longer returns a page with a silent hole in it. A frame it could not reach was dropped, so a tree missing a whole third-party iframe was indistinguishable from a complete one. Unreachable frames are now listed in `unreachableFrames` on the root, each with its `frameId` and `origin`, and the key is absent when every frame answered. This is the ordinary case rather than an exotic one: Safari's **Always Allow on This Website** covers the top-level page only, so every user who granted per site was reading partial pages that looked whole. A frame with no origin to grant (`about:`, `data:`, sandboxed) reports `null` rather than the string `"null"` that the URL parser produces for an opaque origin, which also fixes that string reaching `permission_required` messages for `file://` tabs.
- Touching a site Safari has not been asked about no longer hangs for 30 seconds. Safari asks for website access with a modal dialog and blocks every extension call for that tab until it is answered, and that dialog can open behind another window where nobody knows it exists. Every tool rode that out to the server's 30-second bridge timeout and then reported `bridge_timeout`, which is not what happened and is not something a retry fixes. Tab-touching calls are now probed first with a trivial injection, so a blocked tab fails in about two seconds with `permission_required`, the origin, and the fact that the dialog may be hidden. A blocked `tabs_context` and `screenshot` report the same way. `permissions.contains` is deliberately not used for this: on Safari it reports what the manifest asked for rather than what the user granted, so it answers true for origins with no access.
- `mcp-safari doctor` no longer reports a matching extension version while Safari runs a different build. It read the Info.plist inside the installed app, but Safari runs whichever bundle PlugInKit registered, so a stale copy produced a clean bill of health with the wrong extension driving. The version now comes from the bundle Safari actually loaded.
- Native input no longer tells agents to bring Safari to the front themselves. The refusal said "activate Safari and retry", so agents running in the background activated Safari with `osascript` and took over the user's keyboard and mouse mid-task. The refusal, the `native` parameter descriptions, and the screenshot hidden-page and unfocused-window notes now tell the agent to ask the user first unless the user has already allowed it, and both focus failures report `recoveryAction: "ask_user"`. Losing focus after events were sent is no longer `retryable`, since a retry sends the whole input again. The native `type_text` description also says it types one character at a time, is not paste, and is for short input only.
- Bridge timeouts report the actual action and deadline and no longer recommend blindly repeating a possibly completed mutation. Canceled requests stop waiting, successful/failed requests cancel their timeout tasks, and late replies cannot complete a later request.
- File uploads validate and read one descriptor within a strict remaining byte budget, including when caller-selected paths change concurrently.
- Token publication failure stops the listener and reports a diagnostic. Stdio shutdown removes owned per-port tokens; extension token discovery merges both supported roots.
- Popup website-access status refreshes without overlapping probes and reports messaging failures.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-09-14
### Added
- `mcp-safari --help`, `-h`, `--version`, and `-V`. All four were rejected as unknown arguments before, so the only way to read the version off the binary was `mcp-safari doctor`, which reports on the whole install. Help goes to stdout and exits 0 when asked for explicitly, and wins over anything else on the command line; usage errors still go to stderr with a non-zero status.

### Bug Fixes
- Codex CLI 0.154.0 can connect again. It declares `capabilities.experimental: {"codex/auth-change": {}}` on `initialize`, and the MCP SDK types that field as a map of strings, so decoding failed for the whole request and a valid `initialize` came back as `-32603 "The data couldn't be read because it isn't in the correct format."` The transport now rewrites object values there into their JSON text before the SDK decodes them, which keeps every capability key the client declared. The same shape from other clients, such as ChatGPT's `{"openai/visibility": {"enabled": true}}`, is covered. Clients that send no experimental capabilities, or only string ones, are passed through byte for byte.
- `mcp-safari doctor` no longer reports a working install as broken. It built the server executable path from `argv[0]`, which carries no directory when the binary is invoked by bare name through `$PATH`, so the path resolved against the current directory and the `server_executable` check failed from anywhere but the directory holding the binary. It also exited non-zero while doing so, which ruled it out as a scripted health check.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-09-10
### Added
- `screenshot` accepts `uid` or `selector` to capture one element plus `padding` CSS px of context, and `scale` to shrink the PNG; the result says which viewport CSS px the image covers. A target inside an iframe is refused with `invalid_input`, because the capture covers the top-level viewport while a subframe measures its elements against its own, so cropping to that rect would return a confident picture of the wrong region.

### Bug Fixes
- Safari profiles no longer fight over the extension connection. Safari runs a separate instance of the extension in each profile, with its own background page and its own storage, and every instance reads the same token and dials the same port. The bridge held a single connection, so each instance evicted the one before it and the evicted instance reconnected, which left a two-profile setup connecting and disconnecting in a loop rather than working, including for the profile being driven. The bridge now holds one connection per profile, identified by the profile Safari reports to the app extension. Tool calls still drive one profile, the default when it is connected, and `status` lists every connected profile so the others are visible rather than silently dropped. Targeting a specific profile is not supported yet.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-09
### Added
- Added `mcp-safari doctor` with human-readable and JSON output for installation, version, extension registration, and token checks.
- Added a bridge-independent `status` MCP tool for listener, authentication, version, and token health.
- Added a backward-compatible versioned extension/server handshake with explicit protocol mismatch errors.
- Tool failures now include stable error codes, retry guidance, and recovery actions for disconnected bridges, stale element UIDs, missing targets, and wait timeouts.
- `type_text` now supports opt-in native macOS keyboard events for contenteditable and framework-managed editors.
- Added `upload_file` and `drop_file` for attaching explicit local files to a file input or dropping them onto an element.
- Added `run_steps` for bounded sequential interaction and wait batches with ordered results, first-failure stopping, one optional trace, and one optional final snapshot.
- `screenshot` now reports the viewport size, device pixel ratio, page visibility, and window focus at capture time, so callers can tell device pixels from CSS pixels and can detect a frame captured while Safari was neither repainting the page nor applying `:focus`.
- `read_network` now accepts `type: "resource"` to report PerformanceResourceTiming entries without changing the default XHR/fetch feed, plus `urlPattern` (regex) and `maxResults` filters on any feed and a `status` filter on the XHR/fetch feed. Cross-origin resource entries whose byte counts are withheld are marked `timingRestricted: true`.
- `snapshot` is capped at 2000 nodes and accepts `maxNodes`; a cut tree marks the root `truncated` and each parent whose children were dropped `childrenTruncated`, so a clipped snapshot is distinguishable from a complete one. `read_page` text and html are capped at 100000 characters, accept `maxChars`, and report the full size when they cut.
- `press_key`, `hover`, and `drag` now accept `native: true` for real macOS events, the same opt-in `type_text` already had: keys that trigger default actions such as focus moves and dialog dismissal, a pointer path that produces true CSS `:hover` and boundary events, and drags that threshold-based libraries accept. Character keys resolve against the active keyboard layout, so `Meta+a` is Command-A on AZERTY rather than Command-Q.
- `screenshot` accepts `filePath`: the PNG is written there and the result carries the path and byte count instead of inline image data, so batch captures no longer flood the client context.
- `snapshot`, `find`, `click`, `type_text`, `form_input`, and `wait` now reach into open shadow roots, so a page built on web components no longer returns results that look complete and are not. `snapshot` follows the flattened tree, so content passed into a `<slot>` is reported once, where the slot places it. Closed shadow roots cannot be read by any API, so a custom element that occupies space while reporting no content of its own is marked `shadowClosed` instead of being reported as empty.
- Iframe content is now readable and reachable. `snapshot` returns the tab as one tree, hanging each frame's document on the `<iframe>` that hosts it, and `find` searches every frame. No tool gained a frame argument: a UID routes to its own frame, and a selector or text target searches frames in order, top frame first. A frame whose host `<iframe>` cannot be matched by resolved `src` is attached to the parent tree and counted in `unmatchedFrames` instead of being dropped. Native input still reaches the top frame only, because a subframe cannot read a cross-origin parent's offset, and now fails with `invalid_input` instead of acting on the wrong point. `read_console` and `read_network` continue to report the top frame only.

### Changed
- Added `--log-level` and the `MCP_SAFARI_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable, and lowered the default from `info` to `notice`. Logs go to stderr, which MCP clients surface to the user, so routine startup and connection lines no longer appear unless asked for. `--verbose` is unchanged as a shorthand for `debug`.
- Auth tokens are now written to `~/Library/Application Support/MCPSafari/tokens/<port>` in addition to the previous `~/.config/mcp-safari/tokens/<port>`, and the extension prefers the new location. A `~/.config` symlinked into a dotfiles repo resolves outside the sandboxed extension's read grant, which left the extension permanently disconnected with no diagnostic.
- `mcp-safari doctor` reports a new `token_path` check that warns when the token directory resolves somewhere other than its literal path, and now names the token file path it checked.
- Element UIDs are now frame-qualified: `e42` becomes `f0e42`, where the prefix names the frame that minted it. UIDs are read back from a `snapshot` rather than written by hand, so this only affects anything that stored one across the upgrade.

### Security
- `snapshot` no longer reports the contents of password inputs, or of inputs whose `autocomplete` marks them as a one-time code or payment card field; those values come back as `[redacted]`.
- `tabs_context`, `tabs_create`, `select_tab`, and `navigate` now return tab URLs with the values of `access_token`, `id_token`, `refresh_token`, `client_secret`, `api_key`, and `password` replaced by `[redacted]`; `code` is redacted when the URL also carries an OAuth `state`.

### Bug Fixes
- Element UIDs are now dropped once their element is collected. The reverse lookup held a uid and a `WeakRef` per element for the life of the page, so a long session re-snapshotting a page that re-renders grew it without bound.
- `javascript_tool` no longer fails outright on sites whose Content Security Policy omits `'unsafe-eval'`. Those pages refuse to compile a string in their own realm, which is how the tool runs submitted code, so it now reruns in the extension's isolated world, where the DOM is shared but the page's own JavaScript globals are not, and says so in the result. When both worlds refuse, the error names the tools to use instead of surfacing the raw browser message.
- `run_steps` now accepts `upload_file` and `drop_file`, so a batch that attaches a file no longer has to be split around that step.
- `drop_file` now dispatches from the page's world and gives each dropped item a `webkitGetAsEntry()` whose `file()` resolves. Safari minted an entry for the in-memory File whose `file()` rejected with `NotFoundError`, so folder-aware drop zones that walk entries collected nothing and treated the drop as empty.
- `click` and `hover` with `x`/`y` now dispatch events at the requested point instead of the target element's center, so a specific point inside a large element (e.g. a canvas) can be targeted.
- `click` now dispatches `pointerdown`/`pointerup` ahead of `mousedown`/`mouseup`, and skips the mouse press and focus change when a handler cancels `pointerdown`, matching real input. Pointer-driven toggles such as Radix `DropdownMenu` triggers open instead of reporting a successful click that changed nothing.
- `press_key` and `type_text`'s `submitKey` no longer emit `keypress` for keys that produce no character (Escape, Tab, arrow keys) or for Ctrl/Meta combos, matching the UI Events spec; single characters and Enter still fire it.
- `hover` now dispatches the pointer-event family (`pointerover`/`pointerenter`/`pointermove`) alongside the mouse events in real pointer order, so Pointer Events handlers such as React's `onPointerEnter` run; accepts `x`/`y` coordinates like `click`; and reports that synthetic events never apply CSS `:hover`.
- `drag` now moves along an interpolated pointer-event path with dwell instead of jumping from source to target, so distance-threshold drag libraries (e.g. dnd-kit's `PointerSensor`) start a drag; it fails with `input_not_applied` when the gesture produced no DOM change instead of reporting a silent no-op.
- `type_text` now inserts into model-backed editors (ProseMirror, Lexical, Slate) by driving `document.execCommand("insertText")`, falling back to `beforeinput`/`input` events carrying `inputType` and `data`, instead of a direct DOM mutation with a bare `input` event those editors discard on the next render.
- `type_text` now fails with `input_not_applied` when non-empty text left the target unchanged, instead of reporting success.
- Fixed native typing (`native: true`) always failing with `native_input_focus_lost` while Safari was frontmost: the frontmost check now reads activation state fresh on every call instead of an NSWorkspace value cached at first touch, and runs once before and once after typing instead of per keystroke, and the tool description no longer claims native input foregrounds Safari.
- `select_option` now fails with `target_not_found` instead of reporting success when the requested value matches no option, and restores the previous selection.
- `form_input` now fails with `target_not_found` when no field matched, instead of returning a successful result whose body reads `not found`.
- `read_console` with `clear` now removes only the messages the call returned, so a level- or pattern-filtered read no longer discards unread messages.
- `find` by CSS selector is now capped at 50 matches, the same cap the text and role strategies already used.
- `press_key`, `click`, `hover`, `scroll`, `drag`, `select_option`, and `form_input` now return `invalid_input` for missing or empty required arguments instead of a raw JavaScript error.
- `getAccessibleName` now escapes element ids before building a `label[for=...]` selector, so an id containing a quote no longer fails the whole page's snapshot, and resolves every id in an `aria-labelledby` list rather than only the first.
- `press_key` now reports `Digit1`-style codes for digits instead of `Key1`, and `scroll` treats `amount: 0` as an explicit distance rather than falling back to the viewport height.
- `screenshot` now returns `internal_error` when Safari hands back an empty or non-PNG payload, instead of emitting it as base64 image content and leaving the client to reject the whole result as malformed.
- Fixed `snapshot` dropping an element's own text when that element also has element children, so mixed content such as `<button><span>9</span>All</button>` no longer loses `All`.
- Fixed `find` missing elements named only by `aria-label` or another accessible-name source; `text` now matches the accessible name as well as visible text.
- `find` without `selector`, `text`, or `role` now returns `invalid_input` instead of an empty result that looks like a failed match.
- Fixed `snapshot` crashing on SVG elements with non-string `type` properties.
- Retried trace startup once after an interceptor timeout so a transient `start_trace interceptor did not respond` failure no longer aborts the traced action.
- `javascript_tool` now surfaces runtime throws and rejected promises as tool errors instead of returning `null`; the tool description documents that multi-statement code needs an explicit `return` to produce a value.
- `read_network` with `clear` now removes only the entries the call returned, so a type- or URL-filtered clear no longer discards requests the caller never saw (matching `read_console`).
- Stop stale per-port token files from causing endless extension reconnect attempts and popup state cycling.
- Read the popup version from its manifest, keep ports ordered, and use adaptive system colors for legibility on Safari glass.
- Reinject the content script when Safari returns no message-listener response instead of reporting a successful `null` result.

### Build
- Bumped app, extension, and server versions to `0.3.0`.
- Updated SwiftPM dependencies, including MCP Swift SDK 0.12.1, SwiftLog 1.15.0, and SwiftNIO 2.101.3.
- Updated CI and release builds to Xcode 26.6 and the latest supported major versions of their GitHub Actions.

### CI
- Added the Swift test suite to the main CI workflow.
- Added weekly Dependabot updates for SwiftPM and GitHub Actions dependencies.
- Fixed Swift package URLs generated by the OSV audit so dependency scans no longer fail with invalid requests.

## [0.2.9] - 2026-06-06
### Added
- `select_tab` now exposes its `bringToFront` option (activate and focus the tab, default `true`) in the tool schema and description.

### Documentation
- Documented that `press_key` modifier combos and `drag` dispatch synthetic events and do not trigger native browser actions (clipboard, select-all) or HTML5 drag-and-drop.
- Noted that `read_console`/`read_network` telemetry is captured in the page main world and should be treated as page-controlled data on untrusted pages.

### CI
- Ran the gitleaks secret scan via the non-deprecated `gitleaks git` command.
- Bumped `actions/checkout` to v5 across all workflows to clear the Node 20 runner deprecation.

### Build
- Bumped app, extension, and server versions to `0.2.9`.

## [0.2.8] - 2026-05-07
### Bug Fixes
- Fixed a host app launch crash when SafariServices returned extension state on a non-main XPC callback queue.
- Fixed WebSocket listener startup on systems that reject setting the local port twice.
- Fixed Safari extension autoconnect for authenticated MCP servers by loading tokens from the real macOS home directory and requiring auth before reporting a port connected.
- Fixed navigation responses racing page load completion, which could return stale tab URL/title metadata after `goto`, `back`, `forward`, or `reload`.
- Fixed navigation waits for no-op and same-document navigations so they do not sit on the full page-load timeout.

### Build
- Bumped app, extension, and server versions to `0.2.8`.
- Corrected GitHub Release install instructions to use the current artifact names and recommended Homebrew cask.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-05-06
### Added
- Added optional post-action waits for `navigate` and interaction tools via `waitForSelector`, `waitForText`, and `waitTimeout`.
- Added optional action traces for interaction tools via `trace` and `traceDuration`, capturing URL/history, console, network, and DOM mutation events.

### Bug Fixes
- `javascript_tool` now returns values for bare expression inputs while preserving multi-statement function-body behavior.

### Build
- Bumped app, extension, and server versions to `0.2.7`.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-05-04
### Build
- Updated source builds for Swift 6.3 and pinned the MCP Swift SDK to a Swift 6.3-compatible upstream revision.
- CI and release workflows now explicitly select Xcode 26.4 and fail early if Swift 6.3 is unavailable.

### Security
- WebSocket connections must authenticate before becoming the active bridge connection or receiving MCP tool traffic.
- Auth tokens are now scoped per WebSocket port under `~/.config/mcp-safari/tokens/`, fixing multi-server token races.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed fallback port overflow near `65535`.
- Fixed stale WebSocket connection state from draining or orphaning unrelated pending requests.
- Console, network, and dialog interceptors now run in the page's main JavaScript world and communicate back to the isolated content script.
- App and extension bundle versions and deployment targets now match the advertised `0.2.6` / macOS 14+ release.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-03-28

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed auto-scan flooding: disconnected auto-scan ports no longer appear in the popup — only connected, manual, or previously-connected ports are shown
- Fixed reconnect loop that could freeze the browser: alarm handler was resetting `attempts` to 0 for never-connected ports every 24s, preventing cleanup from ever triggering (`attempts > 3` was unreachable)
- Never-connected auto-scan ports now accumulate failures and get cleaned up after 3 attempts as intended
- Previously-connected ports still get fast backoff reset for quick recovery when a server restarts

### UI
- Empty popup state now shows "Scanning for servers..." instead of "No connections" to indicate background discovery is active

## [0.2.4] - 2026-03-26

### Security
- Auto-scan ports (8089-8098) now **require auth token** to connect — prevents rogue local processes from hijacking the extension
- Without a valid token, auto-discovery is disabled; users must manually add ports (explicit trust)
- Manual ports (user-added via popup) remain trusted without auth for development convenience

### Homebrew
- Cask preflight automatically kills stale `mcp-safari` processes and removes old `/Applications/MCPSafari.app` before installing
- Added `brew upgrade` instructions to README

## [0.2.3] - 2026-03-25

### Auto-Discovery (Secure)
- Extension initializes all ports in the scan range (8089-8098) at startup
- **Auto-scan ports require auth token** — prevents rogue local processes from hijacking the extension
- When native messaging delivers the token, auto-discovery works seamlessly
- When native messaging is unavailable, auto-scan ports are skipped; user must manually add ports (explicit trust)
- Manual ports persisted in `storage.local` (survives Safari restarts); auto-ports are ephemeral
- Auto-discovered ports cleaned up after 2 minutes of disconnection or 3 failed initial attempts

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed reconnect amplification: guard against `CONNECTING` state prevents duplicate socket creation
- Fixed pending request drain on `.cancelled` only applying to the active connection (not a replacement)
- Fixed double JSON parse in WebSocket error handler
- Auth token mismatch now closes the connection instead of leaving it open
- Eliminated probe WebSocket churn (init all ports, connect via normal loop)
- Cleaned up dead code (`TOKEN_FILE_PATH` constant, unused `.btn` CSS)
- `stop()` now nils the listener reference

### UI
- Per-port reconnect (refresh icon) and remove (X) buttons replace global "Reconnect All"
- Auto-discovered ports show "auto" badge; manual ports are always removable
- Connected ports sorted first in the popup

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-25

### Port Auto-Fallback
- Server automatically finds a free port if the requested one is in use (tries up to 10 successive ports)
- Fixes "Address already in use" crash when multiple MCP clients (e.g., Claude Desktop Chat + Cowork) spawn concurrent server instances
- Logs the fallback clearly: `Port 8089 in use — listening on 8090 instead`

### Release Artifact Naming
- Server binaries renamed to `MCPSafari-Server-*` for clarity
- Extension app bundles renamed to `MCPSafari-Extension-*` for clarity

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-25

### Multi-Connection Support
- Extension now supports **multiple simultaneous MCP server connections** — run Claude Code and Claude Desktop (or any number of MCP clients) at the same time, each on its own port
- Extension popup shows all connections with live status indicators
- Add/remove ports from the popup UI
- "Reconnect Disconnected" only retouches broken connections, leaving healthy ones alone
- Configurable WebSocket port per server instance (`--port <n>`)

### Connection Reliability
- Server accepts WebSocket connections immediately (fixed deadlock where `awaitFirstMessage` blocked when extension sent no auth token)
- Auth handshake handled inline in message stream instead of blocking connection setup
- Reduced max reconnect backoff from 30s to 5s for faster recovery
- Keepalive alarm resets backoff so extension reconnects quickly when a new server starts
- Ports persisted across service worker suspensions via `browser.storage.session`

### Token Optimization
- Tool schemas reduced from ~3,500 to ~2,160 tokens (38% reduction)
- Terse descriptions and shared schema fragments minimize LLM context usage
- Removed redundant `get_page_text` tool (use `read_page` with `format: "text"`)
- Removed `title` from tool annotations (LLMs don't use it)
- Server instructions condensed to a single line

### Bug Fixes & Security
- Fixed extension registration on macOS 26 Tahoe — added required `app-sandbox` entitlements
- Fixed release signing: inner-to-outer with entitlements instead of `--deep` (which stripped them)
- Fixed `reload` navigation action fall-through (missing `break` in switch)
- Fixed WebSocket continuation race condition (registration before send)
- Fixed zombie continuations on connection replacement (drain on `.cancelled`)
- Fixed `selectOption` returning "undefined" when resolved by UID
- Fixed `read_page` silently falling through on unknown format
- Fixed `console-interceptor` clearing all levels when filtering by one
- Added URL scheme validation (http/https/about/file only)
- Added regex pattern validation and length cap (200 chars)
- Added `wait` duration cap (300 seconds max)
- Added `buildTree` depth limit (30 levels)

### Infrastructure
- CI and release workflows now run on `macos-26` runners
- CI skips on docs-only changes (`paths-ignore` for `*.md`, `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`)
- Homebrew cask installs app to `/Applications` + CLI binary via formula dependency
- Cask `postflight` auto-opens app to register extension

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-23
